I'm working through HackerRank one problem at a time.. I've done the Python Institute PCEP exam and got 89%, but realised that is not functionally helpful. I am transitioning from an 8 year career in IT into hopefully networking engineer jobs and will eventually be looking to transition into the Azure workspace.
